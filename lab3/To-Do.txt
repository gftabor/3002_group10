2. Load the map. Write a package that reads in the provided map and visualizes it in rviz.
We recommend storing all your map files in a single directory, such as
\home\<yourusername>\maps. Download lab3map.yaml and lab3map.png from the
Resources page and save them in your designated map directory. Then edit the first line of the
yaml file to reference this directory in the path to the image file.
This map describes an occupancy grid of the front room of the RBE Lab. To publish a static
map, download the sample maps from class site and run the following command (be sure to
change the path as appropriate):


3. Create your A* implementation. Implement an A* search to generate paths between two
points in your occupancy grid. Use rviz to set the start and goal points and to display the
progress of the A* algorithm. While searching, the map should visually distinguish expanded,
frontier and unexplored nodes (i.e. make them all different colors). Once the path is found, the
map should display the final path only. Create unique topics for each color of grid cell you will be
using, and name them appropriately. Be sure to load up matching GridCells displays in RViz, and
save any changes you make to the RViz configuration



4. Calculate waypoints. Once the final path has been calculated, extract waypoints representing
the intermediate states the robot would need to achieve to follow the path. Express the
waypoints as a nav_msgs/Path.msg for implementation in future labs in conjunction with Lab 2
